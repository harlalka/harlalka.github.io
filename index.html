        <h3>Bilingual (English-Hindi) OCR system</h3>
        <p>
            I am creating a bilingual optical character recognition (OCR) system for low quality English-Hindi documents. The documents we are targeting have two languages without any well-defined separation. The printing defects create difficulties in recognition using conventional methods.  The project proposes methods of processing the image to adjust for defects and compares the recognition accuracy using neural nets and popular OCR engines. A primary objective was to create an interactive learning system which learns new information using continuous user inputs. The system is developed in Python using popular scientific computation libraries like NumPy, SciPy, Scikit-learn etc.

        <h3>English to Hindi SMS Translator</h3>
        <p>
            We created a machine translation system based on Phrase based translation model for SMS lingo English to Hindi translation. This was a two step translator. First, SMS lingo English was translated to normal English using a rule based translation model. This translated English sentence was then translated to English by a Phrase based translation model. This translator was interfaced with Web, Android devices and SMS services. Evaluation of this translator resulted in a BLEU score of 24.3 (WMT 2011 highest BLEU for phrase based machine translation of French to English was 30.5)

        <h3>htmlPy</h3>
        <h4>GUI development library for Python applications</h4>
        I have developed a Python Library for GUI development in standalone applications using simple web technologies like HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript. I used PyQt4 for rendering HTML pages. This library has efficient ways for development of standalone application using web frameworks like Django. Using some python to binary compilers, the applications can be made closed source to some extent.<br>

        <h3>Deutsche Bank CIB Centre</h3>
        <h4>Programming Internship, Summer 2013</h4>
        <p>
            At Deutsche Bank, I was working in Markets Prime Finance section on Securities Lending desk. My project was to design an algorithm for finding the optimum bid of stock load contracts in Asian markets. I wrote a machine learning algorithm which could price these contracts using the current contract data available. I also created an Anomaly detection algortihm which finds the abnormal contracts in current book which are costing a lot. I created a lots of utilities and combined them with the above algorithm to create Alchemy, a complete stock loan portal. Alchemy created a profit of $4000/day in first two weeks of deployment
